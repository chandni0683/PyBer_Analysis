# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
For this project we need to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our written report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
