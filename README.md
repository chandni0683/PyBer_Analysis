# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
For this project we need to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our written report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
The below chart shows the Total Rides, Total Drivers,	Total Fares,	Average Fare per Ride and	Average Fare per Driver for all three city type:

## Summary
The three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types will be as follows:
1. We should aim at reducing the driver count for rural city type as the averange fare is really high compared to urban and suburban city type.
2. More analysis should be done for suburban city type to analyze if the driver's count should be reduced as the average fare per ride is on the higher side.
3. The weekly sum of fares have been highest for urban city type. More intiatives should be taken to increase the total rides.
